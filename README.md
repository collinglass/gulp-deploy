# gulp-deploy

My setup for deploying static files to rackspace.


This is just a reference repo for future projects. Hopefully it helps someone else.


## What it does

Step 1: Lints my javascript files.

Step 2: Concatenates my javascript files.

Step 3: Minifies my javascript files.

Step 4: Starts watching for changes. (Not really a step)

Step 5: Deploys my static files to rackspace.


### Issues

Keep file structure.
